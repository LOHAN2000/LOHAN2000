## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**LOHAN2000/LOHAN2000** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a live chat page.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and Python because I believe I have yet to discover all their virtues.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m not looking to collaborate on any projects at the moment.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about JavaScript!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: anghelovy00@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He
- âš¡ Fun fact: I always have to code with music and a video playing in the background.
